# Activation-functions-in-expressive-Lipschitz-constrained-networks
This repository contains the code that was used for my (Quinten Berghmans) Master's thesis on "Neural networks as differential equations: a study on the properties of expressive Lipschitz-constrained networks".

Three files can be found: 
- "Optuna_point_classifier_optimiser.ipynb" was used to perform the optimisation of the hyperparameters, for a basic 2d case with no noise
- "Basic_fully_connected_network_Point_classifier_with_different_activation_functions.ipynb" was used to perform the experiments that do not make use of the expressive Lipschitz-constrained architecture, for all 2D/4D, noisy/noiseless, circle/square tests. Both Multiclass hinge loss and Cross entropy are used.
- "Expressive_Lipschitz_constrained_network_for_point_classifier_with_different_activation_functions.ipynb" is used for all experiments with the expressive Lipschitz-constrained architecture.
- "plot_the_activation_functions" is used for the visualization of the activation functions

The files are constructed in such a way, that by adjusting the parameters/constants at the top, the desired experiments are run.
